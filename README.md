### State Management

The app uses **Riverpod** for state management with the following providers:

- `randomRecipesProvider`: Manages random recipe generation
- `savedRecipesProvider`: Handles saved recipe persistence
- `triedRecipesProvider`: Tracks tried recipes
- `recipeFiltersProvider`: Manages recipe filtering options

### Responsive Design

The app implements adaptive design patterns:

- **Mobile (< 600px)**: Bottom navigation, vertical slot layout
- **Tablet (600-1200px)**: Navigation rail, horizontal slot layout
- **Desktop (> 1200px)**: Navigation drawer, optimized for large screens

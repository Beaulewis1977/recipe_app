## ü§ñ Gemini MCP Server Consultation Topics

### 1. Testing Architecture Review
**Prompt:** "Review this Flutter testing strategy for a Recipe Slot App. The app has responsive design, Riverpod state management, and targets mobile/tablet/desktop. Evaluate the testing pyramid approach (70% unit, 20% widget, 10% integration) and suggest improvements for a SaaS app targeting millions of users."

**Include:** TESTING_STRATEGY.md content

### 2. Widget Testing Implementation Strategy
**Prompt:** "I need to implement comprehensive widget tests for a Flutter Recipe Slot App with these key components: SlotMachineWidget (core spinning functionality), RecipeCardStack (swipeable cards), AdaptiveNavigationShell (responsive navigation). The app uses Riverpod for state management. Provide a detailed testing approach including mock strategies, test scenarios, and best practices."

**Include:** Component details from codebase

### 3. Responsive Testing Approach
**Prompt:** "How should I test responsive Flutter widgets that adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? The app has a responsive design system with ScreenSize enum and ResponsiveBuilder widgets. Current tests are failing because screen size detection doesn't match expectations. Provide debugging approach and testing patterns."

**Include:** Responsive system code and failing test details

### 4. Integration Testing Strategy
**Prompt:** "Design an integration testing strategy for a Flutter Recipe Slot App with these critical user flows: 1) Slot machine spinning and recipe generation, 2) Recipe saving/loading with Hive database, 3) API integration for recipe data, 4) Cross-platform functionality. The app targets iOS, Android, and Web. Focus on real-world scenarios and edge cases."

### 5. Performance Testing Implementation
**Prompt:** "Create a performance testing strategy for a Flutter Recipe Slot App targeting millions of users. Key requirements: <3s cold start, <150MB memory, 60 FPS animations, efficient slot machine animations. Include memory leak detection, animation performance testing, and scalability considerations."

### 6. CI/CD Testing Pipeline
**Prompt:** "Design a CI/CD testing pipeline for a Flutter Recipe Slot App with unit, widget, integration, and performance tests. Include automated testing for iOS, Android, and Web platforms, test coverage reporting, and quality gates. Consider GitHub Actions and best practices for Flutter testing automation."

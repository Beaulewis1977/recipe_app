## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### **Flutter/Dart Code Style**
- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `flutter format` to format your code
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

```dart
// Good
class RecipeCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Recipe recipe;
  final VoidCallback onSave;
  
  const RecipeCard({
    Key? key,
    required this.recipe,
    required this.onSave,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Widget implementation
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### **TypeScript/React Code Style**
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices

```typescript
// Good
interface RecipeCardProps {
  recipe: Recipe;
  onSave: () => void;
}

export const RecipeCard: React.FC<RecipeCardProps> = ({ recipe, onSave }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleSave = useCallback(async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      await onSave();
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, [onSave]);
  
  return (
    <div className="recipe-card">
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **General Guidelines**
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Comments**: Write comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- **File Organization**: Keep files focused and well-organized
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of your changes

---

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### **Writing Tests**
- Write unit tests for new functions and classes
- Write integration tests for complex features
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable

### **Flutter Testing**
```dart
// Example widget test
testWidgets('RecipeCard displays recipe information', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  final recipe = Recipe(
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test Recipe',
    image: 'test.jpg',
  );
  
  await tester.pumpWidget(
    MaterialApp(
      home: RecipeCard(recipe: recipe, onSave: () {}),
    ),
  );
  
  expect(find.text('Test Recipe'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

### **Next.js Testing**
```typescript
// Example component test
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { RecipeCard } from './RecipeCard';

test('renders recipe title', () => {
  const recipe = {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test Recipe',
    image: 'test.jpg',
  };
  
  render(<RecipeCard recipe={recipe} onSave={() => {}} />);
  
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Recipe')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
